          description="The Bounty Book app is designed with the purpose of assisting both bounty 
          hunter and bail bondsmen with capturing wanted felons on the run. This app is a work in 
          progress and has a lot of potential. A bounty hunter can signup/login and bid for open 
          bounties in specific states. Using React Maps, the bounty hunter can click on a state which 
          will then return the open bounties in that state (currently in development). On the other 
          hand, a bail bondsman can signup/login and post bounties that they need help resolving. 
          This app was a team project for the Vanderbilt University Full Stack Bootcamp. With very 
          minimal alloted time for completion, my team and I opted for a very basic MVP with implications 
          of future design structure and functionality. My role in this project was to design and style 
          the UI. Some React bootstrap was used for the card layout, but other than that, the styling 
          was done completely with Vanilla JavaScript. I used React to build the components and integrated 
          them into each respective page. Then, each page is called, in the homepage, using React with 
          switch case functionality. The team repository can be found at my team's Github Repository 
          where you will see all of the original commit messages from each teammate. Bounty Book is Mobile 
          Responsive."

          appear to be a one page application. The code is clean and uses best practices (with the exception 
          of the image files being in strict jpeg format). It scored a SEO 100 when I ran a Lighthouse audit, 
          and the UI is polished and mobile responsive. I wanted to get as close to 'React.js' functionality 
          as possible, and feel very good about the outcome."

          interactive site, but also, provided a much more visual appeal. JQuery is a key
          element in the base code of the javaScript, providing a library of cool 'shortcuts' which kept
          the code neat, clean, and minimal. The Day Planner App is a fully functioning hourly planner
          that recognizes time slots, and tracks the current time of day to assign a reference of the
          past, present and future times. Each pretense is assigned a color code. These color codes
          change according to real time. All tasks are stored in local storage so they can be accesssed
          even after the page has been closed and reopened, or simply refreshed. The date at the head
          of the document is also displayed in real time, so the date will change in real time, as well."
