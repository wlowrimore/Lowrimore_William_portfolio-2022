## Description

### Hello, friends. I'm William!

With an intense ride down the super highway of Full Stack Coding Bootcamp behind me, I am now geared up and excited to take flight in the real world of Web Development! Since first receiving word of acceptance to the bootcamp, I have been coding daily. The feeling of creating something so unique and powerful that yields, not just a playful product, but a product designed to maximize success for any and all buisness platforms, is exhilarating and satisfying!<br><br>

With so much more still to learn, I have created this simple, yet functionally sound Portfolio. With lots of styling packages available, I chose to use only Vanilla CSS to design the UI. React.js is the engine where I've created each component for rendering in the "root" of the html document. Rendering of these components was built with a simple "switch / case" function, and on the Contact page you will find a pop-up Modal that houses Emailjs for the user's questions and/or comments. The contact form provides me with the user's input by emailing it directly to my gmail acount.<br><br>

Now, because I'm fresh out of school, my resume lacks something important..."work experience". This is "IMPORTANT" not because I lack the experience, but because I am adaptable...moldable if you will. Most importantly I am excited to learn!<br><br>

So, check out my portfolio, and if you would like a printout of my resume, there is a link to do that on the Resume page. If you have a role that you think would suit me, please contact me. All of my contact information is right here in the Github repository. Otherwise, you can contact me throught the live site. Thanks for looking...ENJOY!<br><br>
